LIDATEC is happy to announce we have published "Guidelines for Maintaining and Documenting IFLA Vocabularies" and it is available in the IFLA Repository: https://repository.ifla.org/handle/123456789/2887

This document is for the IFLA Review Groups to guide them in how to maintain and document their standards on the IFLA Namespaces, and to uphold IFLA policies and objectives related to the IFLA standards. These guidelines are there to ensure that the standards included on the website have clear information introducing them and have appropriate links to more information, including who is responsible for the standard and how to contact them, along with information about the version, updates and releases. These guidelines are also for those using the standards to know what to expect on the IFLA Namespaces. Information about the IFLA Review Groups can be found on the IFLA Namespaces, which is where you can find links to their websites, contact information and other information about them and the standards they maintain.
