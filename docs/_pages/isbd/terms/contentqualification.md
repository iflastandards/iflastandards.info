## Overview

This page introduces the ISBD Element Sets and Value Vocabularies.

## ISBD Element Sets

* [ISBD Elements]({{"/isbd/elements.html" | relative_url}})  
  The ISBD element set is a registration of classes and properties from International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), consolidated edition, published by De Gruyter Saur in July 2011 (ISBN 978-3-11-026379-4).

* [ISBD Elements (unconstrained)]({{"/isbd/unc/elements.html" | relative_url}})  
  The ISBD element set is a registration of classes and properties from International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), consolidated edition, published by De Gruyter Saur in July 2011 (ISBN 978-3-11-026379-4). This version has the same local URI part, label, and definition as each element in the constrained version, but no domain (i.e. Resource) or range is declared.

## ISBD Value Vocabularies

The ISBD element set vocabulary includes RDF classes and properties corresponding to ISBD elements. Six concept vocabularies give the controlled terminologies of the ISBD area 0 content forms, qualifications, and media types. Each class, concept, and property has a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for use in Semantic Web data triples.

* [ISBD Content Form]({{"/isbd/terms/contentform.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content form categories reflect the fundamental form or forms in which the content of a resource is expressed.

* [ISBD Content Form Qualified Base]({{"/isbd/terms/contentformbase.html" | relative_url}})  
  Compound terms for qualified ISBD content forms that map to RDA/ONIX Framework for Resource Categorization base content categories.

* [ISBD Content Qualification of Dimensionality]({{"/isbd/terms/contentqualification/dimensionality.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content qualification sub-categories for the number of spatial dimensions in which the image content of a resource is intended to be perceived which expand the content form category of image.

* [ISBD Content Qualification of Motion]({{"/isbd/terms/contentqualification/motion.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content qualification sub-categories for the perceived presence or absence of movement in the image content of a resource which expand the content form category of image.

* [ISBD Content Qualification of Sensory Specification]({{"/isbd/terms/contentqualification/sensoryspecfication.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content qualification sub-categories for sensory specification, a human sense through which the content of a resource as published is intended to be perceived, which expand content form categories.

* [ISBD Content Qualification of Type]({{"/isbd/terms/contentqualification/type.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content qualification sub-categories for type which expand content form categories.

* [ISBD Media Type]({{"/isbd/terms/mediatype.html" | relative_url}})  
  Media type categories record the type or types of carrier used to convey the content of the resource. Categories generally reflect the format of the storage medium and housing of a carrier in combination with the type of intermediation device required to render, view, run, etc., the content of a resource.
