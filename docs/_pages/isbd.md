## Overview

This page introduces the FRBR Element Sets and Value Vocabularies.

## ISBD Element Sets

* [ISBD Elements]({{"/isbd/elements.html" | relative_url}})  
  This is the element set of native RDF classes and properties described in the Functional Requirements for Authority Data model. The model also uses elements previously described in the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) entity-relationship model.

* [ISBD Elements (unconstrained)]({{"/isbd/unc/elements.html" | relative_url}})  
  This is the element set of native RDF classes and properties described in the current text (Feb 2009) of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) entity-relationship model.

## ISBD Value Vocabularies

* [ISBD Content Form]({{"/isbd/terms/contentform.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content form categories reflect the fundamental form or forms in which the content of a resource is expressed.

* [ISBD Content Form Qualified Base]({{"/isbd/terms/contentformbase.html" | relative_url}})  
  Compound terms for qualified ISBD content forms that map to RDA/ONIX Framework for Resource Categorization base content categories.

* [ISBD Content Qualification of Dimensionality]({{"/isbd/terms/contentqualification/dimensionality.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content qualification sub-categories for the number of spatial dimensions in which the image content of a resource is intended to be perceived which expand the content form category of image.

* [ISBD Content Qualification of Motion]({{"/isbd/terms/contentqualification/motion.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content qualification sub-categories for the perceived presence or absence of movement in the image content of a resource which expand the content form category of image.

* [ISBD Content Qualification of Sensory Specification]({{"/isbd/terms/contentqualification/sensoryspecfication.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content qualification sub-categories for sensory specification, a human sense through which the content of a resource as published is intended to be perceived, which expand content form categories.

* [ISBD Content Qualification of Type]({{"/isbd/terms/contentqualification/type.html" | relative_url}})  
  Content qualification sub-categories for type which expand content form categories.

* [ISBD Media Type]({{"/isbd/terms/mediatype.html" | relative_url}})  
  Media type categories record the type or types of carrier used to convey the content of the resource. Categories generally reflect the format of the storage medium and housing of a carrier in combination with the type of intermediation device required to render, view, run, etc., the content of a resource.
