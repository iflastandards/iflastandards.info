            <h3>Background and history</h3>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>International Standard Bibliographic Description, or ISBD, has been positioned,
                from its very conception, at the centre of IFLA's programme Universal Bibliographic
                Control (UBC), and as such has been charged with the task of responding to changes
                in the information environment. The first standard edition of ISBD was ISBD(M):
                International Standard Bibliographic Description for Monographic Publications. It
                was published in 1971 as a result of international agreement on the form – printed
                catalogue card, and content – areas of data elements, achieved at the International
                Meeting of Cataloguing Experts in Copenhagen in 1969.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>In the fifty years since, ISBD underwent constant development by expansion to cover
                different types of material, from printed and manuscript publications to electronic
                and web resources. The latest version was published in 2022. During this period of
                change, ISBD became instrumental in the development of MARC (Machine Readable
                Cataloguing) formats, and in particular to the IFLA UNIMARC: UNIversal MAchine
                Readable Cataloguing Format which was first published in 1977, by providing a
                content standard for its encoding structure.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>The publication in 1998 of the conceptual model Functional Requirements for
                Bibliographic Records (FRBR) marked the beginning of a new conceptualisation of the
                bibliographic universe of UBC in sync with an entity-relationship framework as a
                response to the changing technological environment. FRBR created two basic points of
                departure from ISBD: the grouping of metadata around entities that reflect user
                tasks and points of interest in the bibliographic universe as opposed to the linear
                presentation of ISBD data; and the use of four entities (Work, Expression,
                Manifestation, and Item, or WEMI) in place of a monolithic object of bibliographic
                description (ISBD's &quot;resource&quot;).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>ISBD responded to the second challenge in its 2011 consolidated edition, by
                including a full section in its Introduction on &quot;ISBD and FRBR
                relationship&quot;. Apart from conforming ISBD data elements with FRBR ones with
                respect to mandatory and optional status, further steps in this direction were not
                possible because the concepts and their terminology had become an obstacle. That is,
                ISBD could not easily adopt the WEMI concepts and terms, and resolved instead to
                retain &quot;resource&quot;, as its specific terminology. In terms of FRBR,
                &quot;the ISBD is applied to describe manifestations, by means of description of the
                item in hand as an exemplar of the entire manifestation&quot;.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>However, ISBD did respond, within its scope, to the new technological changes. In
                the section on &quot;Purpose of the ISBD&quot;, a new aim was added, to
                &quot;enhance the portability of bibliographic data in the Semantic Web environment
                and the interoperability of the ISBD with other content standards&quot;. This was a
                result of activities initiated by the ISBD Review Group in 2008, and was realised by
                including a list of the ISBD data elements in a special table at the end of the
                &quot;Outline of the ISBD&quot; section. This list became the basis for publishing
                an ISBD element set in Resource Description Framework (RDF), the basic syntax of the
                Semantic Web, initially in the <a class="linkOutline"
                  href="http://metadataregistry.org/" target="_blank">Open Metadata Registry</a> in
                2015 and since 2020 as the ISBD Vocabularies in the <a class="linkOutline"
                  href="https://www.iflastandards.info/" target="_blank">IFLA Namespaces
                  registry</a>. The decision to encompass the new online information environment and
                to react to it within the scope of its purpose, so that ISBD elements can be used to
                encode bibliographic data as linked open data in the Semantic web environment,
                empowered ISBD's position as a relevant international content standard, not only for
                human but also for machine use.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>The publication in 2017 of the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM) that superseded
                the FR family of models, including FRBR, marked the full conformance of the IFLA's
                conceptual model for the bibliographic universe with the current technology to
                support semantic linked data. It became obvious, following the release of LRM's
                draft versions, that the new model would have a significant impact on the ISBD,
                which would have to undergo a major reconstruction as well as reconceptualization in
                order to position itself as an implementation of the LRM. The position of the ISBD
                in relation to the FRBR WEMI entities, the core entities of the LRM, was already
                acknowledged in the 2011 edition. What was required was an understanding of the
                direction of a &quot;reconstruction as well as reconceptualization&quot; of the
                standard.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>The ISBD Review Group set up the ISBD Manifestation Task Force in 2019 to develop
                the ISBD, with the following terms of reference and deliverables:</p>
              <p>Terms of reference</p>
              <ol class="num">
                <li>Complete an alignment of the ISBD to the LRM at the Manifestation level, working
                  out an element set for that alignment.</li>
                <li>Analyse the gaps, i.e. the elements of the 2021 Update of the ISBD Consolidated
                  edition 2011; that in the cited alignment have been excluded, and that are
                  considered mandatory, mandatory if the information is available, or optional.</li>

                <li>Reflection on Transforming the ISBD into a Full Implementation of the LRM, a
                  working document that will constitute the basis of the future work encompassing
                  all of the LRM elements and other components, and which would entail rethinking
                  the structure of the ISBD.</li>

              <p>Following the ISBD Review Group members’ individual review, at its January 2024
                meeting the ISBD Review Group approved of the draft ISBD for Manifestation and
                decided to forward it to the review of the wider interested communities.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>The ISBD Review Group and the ISBD for Manifestation Task Force received responses
                from 8 institutions with about 160 comments containing feedback from the expert’s
                and World-wide reviews. The Task Force did not see anything in the feedback delaying
                the planned submission of the ISBDM to the internal IFLA standards approval process,
                and the ISBD Review Group submitted the draft version of ISBD for Manifestation to
                the Committee on Standards on 17th October 2024. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="guid">
              <p>To meet the second deliverable the submission to the Committee on Standards

                LRM. Phase 2 alignment: ISBD for LRM. Report to the Advisory Committee on Standards,
                October 2024&quot;. The report finds that, although the ISBDM can be used as a
                standalone single-entity standard, the advantages for a multiple-entity ISBD
                overweighs those of a single-entity ISBD, and proposes to set up a new task force
                for a phase 2 of the alignment project. The report also proposes a phase 2 project
                output, and a working method developed by the first phase.</p>

              <p>The ISBD Review Group received the review with comments from the Committee on

                Manifestation Task Force edited the standard following given comments, and
