                characteristics of the expressions that are aggregated are included in the
                description of the aggregating work. The main utility in describing the aggregating
                expression occurs when the same set of expressions is embodied in alternate
                manifestations or reproductions. Instead of relating each manifestation to each
                expression that is aggregated, the aggregating expression can be related to each
                expression that is aggregated via a shortcut Expression relationship element, and
