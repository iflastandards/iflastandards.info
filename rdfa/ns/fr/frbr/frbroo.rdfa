    <div property="rdfs:comment" xml:lang="en" content="This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations bounded in time and space. It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatio-temporal bounds. These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture. Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the "Neolithic Period", the "Ming Dynasty" or the "McCarthy Era". There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor. There are two different conceptualisations of "artistic style", defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, "Impressionism" can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type. Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh. [This is the Scope note for E4 Period in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1] [Note that in CIDOC CRM, E12 Production, E13 Attribute Assignment, and E65 Creation are indirect subclasses of E4 Period = F8 Event; as a consequence, F8 Event is an indirect superclass of: F27 Work Conception, F28 Expression Creation, F40 Identifier Assignment, F41 Representative Manifestation Assignment, F42 Representative Expression Assignment, F32 Carrier Production Event, F33 Reproduction Event, and F30 Publication Event]"></div>

    <div property="skos:scopeNote" xml:lang="en" content="The substance of Work is concepts. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time. A Work may have members that constitute components of the overall concept or that are alternatives to other members of the work. Members of a work may or may not represent the concept of the Work as a whole; for instance a translation reinterprets the whole, a volume of a trilogy represents a part of the concept. A Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists of members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works. The member relationship of Work is based on the members respecting the same concept, and should not be confused with the structural parts of an expression, that might be taken from other work(s). A Work is the product of an intellectual process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere, and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume that a work starts with a complete concept. Moreover, it can be very difficult or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at some given time. The only objective evidence for such a notion can be based on a stage of expressions at a given time. In this sense, self-contained expressions serve as a kind of "snap-shots" of a work. A Work may aggregate expressions of other works into a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression."></div>

In this case, the copies, but not the original, may be regarded as instances of F5 Item. It is the existence of an explicit production plan that makes the difference.

    <div property="rdfs:comment" xml:lang="en" content="This class comprises activities that consist in making copies, more or less mechanically, of an instance of E84 Information Carrier (such as an F5 Item or an F4 Manifestation Singleton which is also instance of E84 Information Carrier), preserving the expression carried by it. A Reproduction Event results in new instances of E84 Information Carrier coming into existence. In general, the copy will have different attributes from the original and they are therefore not regarded as siblings. This class makes it possible to account for the legal distinction between private copying for the purpose of "fair use", and mass production for the purpose of dissemination. It can prove difficult to determine where to draw the line between F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event in cases where multiple copies are produced. In this case, the copies, but not the original, may be regarded as instances of F5 Item. It is the existence of an explicit production plan that makes the difference. As a consequence, F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event are not declared as disjoint, which makes it possible to account for such situations that could be regarded as instances of both Production Event and Reproduction Event."></div>

Expressions cannot exist without a physical carrier, but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. Carriers may include human memory. Inasmuch as the form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression, any change in form (e.g., from alpha-numeric notation to spoken word, a poem created in capitals and rendered in lower case) is a new F2 Expression. Similarly, changes in the intellectual conventions or instruments that are employed to express a work (e.g., translation from one language to another) result in the creation of a new F2 Expression. Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the resulting F2 Expression is considered to be a new F2 Expression. Minor changes, such as corrections of spelling and punctuation, etc., are normally considered variations within the same F2 Expression. On a practical level, the degree to which distinctions are made between variant expressions of a work will depend to some extent on the nature of the F1 Work itself, and on the anticipated needs of users. The genre of the work may provide an indication of which features are essential to the expression. In some cases, aspects of physical form, such as typeface and page layout, are not integral to the intellectual or artistic realisation of the work as such, and therefore are not distinctive criteria for the respective expressions. For another work features such as layout may be essential. For instance, the author or a graphic designer may wrap a poem around an image. An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression. If an instance of F2 Expression is of a specific form, such as text, image, etc., it may be simultaneously instantiated in the specific classes representing these forms in CIDOC CRM.
