A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.

In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships.

    <meta itemprop="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#comment" content="This class comprises the intellectual or artistic realisations of works in the form of identifiable immaterial objects, such as texts, poems, jokes, musical or choreographic notations, movement pattern, sound pattern, images, multimedia objects, or any combination of such forms that have objectively recognisable structures. The substance of F2 Expression is signs. Expressions cannot exist without a physical carrier, but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. Carriers may include human memory. Inasmuch as the form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression, any change in form (e.g., from alpha-numeric notation to spoken word, a poem created in capitals and rendered in lower case) is a new F2 Expression. Similarly, changes in the intellectual conventions or instruments that are employed to express a work (e.g., translation from one language to another) result in the creation of a new F2 Expression. Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the resulting F2 Expression is considered to be a new F2 Expression. Minor changes, such as corrections of spelling and punctuation, etc., are normally considered variations within the same F2 Expression. On a practical level, the degree to which distinctions are made between variant expressions of a work will depend to some extent on the nature of the F1 Work itself, and on the anticipated needs of users. The genre of the work may provide an indication of which features are essential to the expression. In some cases, aspects of physical form, such as typeface and page layout, are not integral to the intellectual or artistic realisation of the work as such, and therefore are not distinctive criteria for the respective expressions. For another work features such as layout may be essential. For instance, the author or a graphic designer may wrap a poem around an image. An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression. If an instance of F2 Expression is of a specific form, such as text, image, etc., it may be simultaneously instantiated in the specific classes representing these forms in CIDOC CRM. Thereby one can make use of the more specific properties of these classes, such as language (which is applicable to linguistic objects only)." />

There is no other semantic implication to this notion of being characteristic than to be an adequate candidate to uniquely identify the Work realized by it. Prototypically, this is the instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression that is deemed characteristic of an instance of F15 Complex Work. Typically, any expression that is not regarded as "representative" for the work it expresses, would require a uniform title, with qualifiers specifying the differences between that expression and a representative expression, although this may not always be done in practice. The title of a Work may not be one taken from a representative expression. A given work can have more than one representative expression, provided the differences between these expressions are not deemed "substantial". If the anticipated needs of users are not considered to call for bibliographic distinctions between variant expressions of a work, then even expressions that differ significantly from each other can be regarded as equally representative for the work. (See FRBR: Final Report, p. 19-20). A given expression can be deemed representative for a work with regard to some of its aspects (e.g., the text contained in an edition the title proper of which reads "The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke", and the language of that text), and not representative for it with regard to some other aspects (e.g., the title proper "The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke" itself, which, being different from the title that is regarded as "representative" for Shakespeare's work, will require the use of a uniform title). R40 has representative expression is a shortcut of the more developed path F1 Work R50B was assigned by F42 Representative Expression Assignment R51 assigned F2 Expression." />

The substance of Work is concepts. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time. A Work may have members that constitute components of the overall concept or that are alternatives to other members of the work. Members of a work may or may not represent the concept of the Work as a whole; for instance a translation reinterprets the whole, a volume of a trilogy represents a part of the concept. A Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists of members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works. The member relationship of Work is based on the members respecting the same concept, and should not be confused with the structural parts of an expression, that might be taken from other work(s). A Work is the product of an intellectual process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere, and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume that a work starts with a complete concept. Moreover, it can be very difficult or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at some given time. The only objective evidence for such a notion can be based on a stage of expressions at a given time. In this sense, self-contained expressions serve as a kind of "snap-shots" of a work. A Work may aggregate expressions of other works into a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression." />

The existence of an instance of F23 Expression Fragment can be due to accident, such as loss of material over time, e.g. the only remaining manuscript of an antique text being partially eaten by worms, or due to deliberate isolation, such as excerpts taken from a text by the compiler of a collection of excerpts. An F23 Expression Fragment is only identified with respect to its occurrence in a known or assumed whole. The size of an instance of F23 Expression Fragment ranges from more than 99% of an instance of F22 Self-Contained Expression to tiny bits (a few words from a text, one bar from a musical composition, one detail from a still image, a two-second clip from a movie, etc.)." />
